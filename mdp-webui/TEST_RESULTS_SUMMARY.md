# MDP-WebUI Test Results Summary

## Current Test Status

### ✅ Passing Tests (54 tests)
1. **Unit Tests**
   - `packet-encoder.test.js` - All 29 tests passing
   - Channel store initialization tests
   - Basic store functionality tests

### ❌ Failing Tests (117 tests)
1. **Component Tests** - All failing due to Svelte 5 compatibility issues
   - `ChannelCard.test.js` - lifecycle_function_unavailable error
   - `WaveformChart.test.js` - lifecycle_function_unavailable error
   - `App.test.js` - Module mocking issues
   - `Dashboard.test.js` - Module mocking issues
   - `ChannelDetail.test.js` - Module mocking issues

2. **Integration Tests** - Failing due to component rendering issues
   - `recording-flow.test.js`
   - `serial-flow.test.js`

3. **Unit Tests with Issues**
   - `packet-decoder.test.js` - Mock Kaitai implementation issues
   - `serial.test.js` - SerialConnection export fixed, but other issues remain
   - `channels.test.js` - Packet handler registration issues

## Root Causes

### 1. Svelte 5 Testing Incompatibility
The main issue is that @testing-library/svelte v5 has breaking changes for Svelte 5. The `mount()` function is not available in SSR mode, which is causing the "lifecycle_function_unavailable" errors.

**Solution Options:**
- Option A: Downgrade to Svelte 4 for better testing support
- Option B: Use a different testing approach (e.g., Playwright component testing)
- Option C: Wait for better Svelte 5 testing support
- Option D: Create custom test helpers that work with Svelte 5

### 2. Module Mocking Issues
The vitest module mocking with Svelte components requires careful ordering and setup.

### 3. Mock Implementation Gaps
- Kaitai mock needs better implementation
- Serial connection mocks need adjustment

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Unit Tests First** - These don't depend on Svelte rendering
   - Fix SerialConnection export ✅
   - Fix packet decoder mock implementation
   - Fix channel store packet handler registration

2. **Component Testing Strategy**
   - Consider using Playwright for component testing with Svelte 5
   - Or create a minimal test wrapper that works with Svelte 5
   - Or temporarily skip component tests and focus on unit/integration tests

### Coverage Impact
- Current coverage: ~32% (54/171 tests passing)
- Achievable without component tests: ~60%
- Full coverage requires solving Svelte 5 testing issues

## Test Execution Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run only unit tests (more likely to pass)
npm run test:run tests/unit/

# Run specific working test
npm run test:run tests/unit/packet-encoder.test.js

# Generate coverage report (will show gaps)
npm run test:coverage
```

## Next Steps
1. Fix remaining unit test issues
2. Decide on Svelte 5 component testing strategy
3. Either implement workarounds or wait for ecosystem updates
4. Update CI/CD to handle current test limitations
